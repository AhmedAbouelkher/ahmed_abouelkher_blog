# Ahmed M. Abouelkher Blog

Reading technical blogs to fix an issue of mine has become a habit, reading the docs and the source code is the best way to fix my issues, but still I find myself reading blogs to get a better understanding of the issue.

Technical blogs has their own personal touch, but not always the correct version of the truth, so I decided to start my own blog to share my own experience and knowledge, and I made it public so I can get feedback from the community.

I hesitated a lot before starting this blog, I was afraid that I will not be able to keep it up, but I decided to start it anyway, and I will try my best to keep it up.

My main inspiration was the amazing [Putting the “You” in CPU](https://cpu.land/) blog, I really like the way it is written, and I hope I can write something similar one day.

Writing in public was not my first choice, I was thinking about writing in private and publishing it later, but I decided to write in public to get feedback from the community, and to force myself to write more.

English is not my first language, so I might make a mistake here and there, that's way I pay 10$/month for Github Copilot 😅

BTW, Any technical opinion of mine, well, its mine, and please, Do not use it to prove your point, always Weight the options, Use your brain and Make your own decision.

I hope you enjoy reading my blog, and I hope I can help you in any way.

Thank you for reading.
